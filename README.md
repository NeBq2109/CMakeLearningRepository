# CMakeLearningRepository


This directory contains source code examples for the CMake Tutorial. It has been created to enhance my skills in using creating CMake solution and to get familiar with parametrization options.

To build following code use these commands at the **root** of the repository:
```
mkdir StepN_build
cd StepN_build
cmake ../StepN
cmake --build .
```
